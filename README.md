# American-Sign-Language-Detection
This project develop an real-time sign language detection model using technologies like Mediapipe and OpenCV. The project begins by collecting real sign language images, which serve as the training dataset for the system. The final step involves converting the recognized text into speech using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) Python library.
